# Paper Reader Agent & Evaluation System - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction

### Product Overview
A comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes academic PDFs into a queryable knowledge base and provides intelligent question-answering capabilities. The system includes a paper reading agent, web-based interface, and comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing performance across retrieval, generation, and system metrics. Built with privacy in mind, it operates entirely locally using Ollama for LLM and embedding services.

### Target Audience
Primary users include researchers and academics who need to efficiently extract and query information from large collections of academic PDF documents. Secondary users include students working with research papers, professionals analyzing technical documents, and developers building local document Q&A systems. The system is designed for users who prioritize data privacy and want to avoid cloud-based solutions.

## Core Features

## Constraints and Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- **Ollama Dependency**: Requires local Ollama server running with specific models (nomic-embed-text for embeddings, llama3.2:latest for LLM) - users must install and configure Ollama separately
- **PDF Processing**: Limited to text-based content only - no support for image extraction, table parsing, or complex document layouts
- **Storage Requirements**: Vector storage requires sufficient disk space for FAISS indices and metadata files - approximately 1-2GB per 1000 PDF pages
- **Performance**: Heavily depends on local hardware capabilities and model sizes - minimum 8GB RAM recommended for processing large documents

### Functional Limitations
- **Language Support**: Currently supports only English language processing - no multi-language support or translation capabilities
- **Collaboration**: No real-time collaboration features - single-user system only
- **Document Types**: Limited to academic and text-based PDFs - not optimized for scanned documents or image-heavy content
- **Real-time Updates**: No automatic updates to knowledge base when source documents change

### Security Considerations
- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs locally, ensuring privacy but requiring local computational resources
- **No Cloud Storage**: No automatic backup or synchronization with cloud services
- **Model Security**: Depends on the security of locally installed Ollama models
